## Determining the level of minor intron retention.

The purpose of this bash script is to determine the level of minor intron retention. This is established by quantifying reads aligned to exon-minor intron boundaries. This information is then used in combination with the output of the minor-intron-splicing script to generate mis-splicing indices for each minor intron.
